# Go CLI Tic Tac Toe with Minimax AI

## Description

This is a command-line interface (CLI) implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, written in the Go programming language. You play as Player 'X' against a challenging computer opponent ('O') that uses the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves, making it play optimally.

## Features

* Classic Tic Tac Toe gameplay on a 3x3 grid.
* Text-based command-line interface.
* Human player ('X') vs. Computer player ('O').
* "Smart" AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.
* Input validation for player moves.
* Clear board display with numbered cells (1-9) for easy input.
* Win, loss, and draw detection.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

* You need to have Go installed on your system. You can check this by running `go version` in your terminal. If you don't have it, download and install it from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Steps

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the Go source code provided into a file named `tictactoe.go`.
2.  **Open Terminal:** Navigate to the directory where you saved `tictactoe.go` using your terminal or command prompt.
3.  **Run:** Execute the following command:
    ```bash
    go run tictactoe.go
    ```

## Gameplay

1.  The game will start, welcoming you and displaying the empty board with numbered cells (1-9) as a reference.
    ```
    -------------
    | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    -------------
    | 4 | 5 | 6 |
    -------------
    | 7 | 8 | 9 |
    -------------
    ```
2.  You play as 'X' and go first.
3.  When prompted (`Enter your move (number 1-9):`), type the number corresponding to the cell where you want to place your 'X' and press Enter.
4.  The board will update with your move.
5.  The computer ('O') will then make its move, choosing the optimal spot based on the Minimax algorithm. The board will update again, showing the computer's move.
6.  Turns alternate until one player gets three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or the board is full (resulting in a draw).
7.  The game announces the outcome (Win, Loss, or Draw).

## Code Structure Overview

* **`main.go`**: The single source file containing all the game logic.
* **`board [3][3]string`**: A type alias for the 3x3 array representing the game board.
* **Constants**: `playerX`, `playerO`, `emptyCell` define the markers used on the board.
* **Board Handling**:
    * `initializeBoard()`: Creates a new, empty board.
    * `printBoard()`: Displays the current state of the board to the console.
    * `getAvailableMoves()`: Returns a list of empty cells.
* **Game State Check**:
    * `checkWin()`: Checks if the specified player has won.
    * `isBoardFull()`: Checks if the board is full (for draw condition).
* **Player Input**:
    * `getPlayerMove()`: Prompts the human player for input, validates it (checks if it's a number 1-9 and if the cell is empty), and returns the chosen cell coordinates.
* **AI Logic (Minimax)**:
    * `evaluateBoard()`: Assigns a score to a terminal board state (+10 for AI win, -10 for Player win, 0 for draw).
    * `minimax()`: The core recursive function that explores the game tree. It simulates moves for both players, assuming optimal play, to determine the best possible score achievable from a given state.
    * `findBestMove()`: Uses the `minimax` function to evaluate all possible moves for the computer and selects the one leading to the highest score (optimal move).
* **`main()` Function**: Orchestrates the game flow â€“ initializes the board, manages turns, gets moves (from player or AI), checks for game end conditions, and prints results.

## AI Opponent Details

The computer opponent uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a standard algorithm for decision-making in two-player, zero-sum games like Tic Tac Toe.

1.  **Goal:** Maximize its own score while assuming the opponent (human player) will try to minimize it.
2.  **Scoring:** Wins are typically assigned a positive score (e.g., +10), losses a negative score (e.g., -10), and draws a neutral score (0).
3.  **Recursion:** The algorithm explores all possible sequences of moves from the current state down to the end of the game (terminal states: win, loss, draw).
4.  **Optimal Play:** By backtracking from the terminal states and choosing moves that lead to the best possible score outcome (maximizing for itself, minimizing for the opponent), the AI plays optimally. In Tic Tac Toe, this means the AI will always win if the player makes a mistake, and will force a draw otherwise.

## Generation Note

This Go program and this README file were generated by **Google's Gemini AI**. The prompt requested the creation of a command-line Tic Tac Toe game in Go, featuring a "smart" computer opponent. The implementation uses the Minimax algorithm to fulfill the requirement for a challenging AI.
